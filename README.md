# SankeyPlot - R

A Sankey diagram is a visualization used to depict a flow from one set of values to another.

Sankey diagrams are named after the Irishman Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey, who first used this type of diagram in a publication on the energy efficiency of a steam engine in 1898.

I have automated the code to generate Sankey Plot and used for Comparing Community Constituencies.

A short video of the plot is available - Sankey.mp4
